The main question to be answered in this project is the number of survivors in relation to the total population and how many of them were women and how many were men as well as the age at which the largest number of survivors are found and, finally, the socioeconomic level of the survivors using the column where the fare paid by each passenger is stored.

# Advertising Data Set

In this dataset we have the advertising expenditure made in different media such as *TV*, *Radio* and *Newspaper*, in this project what we are looking for is to find which are the best media to advertise in order to have better sales. For that, we will divide our data set in two (using the 80-20 rule), where for our training set we will use 80% of the data and to validate our model we will use the remaining 20%.

We will see at the end if it is convenient to keep only one advertising media or a combination.
